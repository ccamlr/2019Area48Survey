= SDWBApackage2010 

This directory contains the code necessary to calculate krill target strength based on the Stochastic Distorted-Wave Born Approximation model parameterized by body digitization.

It is an extract of relevant files from version 1.1 (June 2012) of the SDWBApackage2010 software.

These files have been slightly modified to allow for running the software programmatically from other Matlab code, rather than from the GUI (as provided by the SDWBApackage2010)
